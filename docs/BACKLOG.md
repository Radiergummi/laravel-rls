# Backlog

Remaining work to take `laravel-rls` from validated PoC to a package you'd
publish. Ordered roughly by priority within each group. Each item notes *why*
and *where* it touches the code.

---

## P0 — Correctness & safety hardening (do before any real use)

- [x] **Production leak canary.** `RlsManager::checkForLeak()` clears any stale
  context and surfaces it per config `leak_canary` (`log` default | `throw` |
  `off`). Wired to Octane `RequestReceived` and queue `Looping` — deliberately
  *not* `JobProcessing`, which fires after Laravel hydrates the job's own context
  and would flag every job as a leak; `Looping` fires between jobs before
  hydration (`--once` is a fresh process, needs no check). *Design §4/§18.*

- [x] **Context value validation at `set()` time.** `RlsManager::push()`
  validates every value against the declared `ContextSchema` type via
  `ContextSchema::matches()`, throwing `InvalidContextValue` in PHP before a
  malformed value can reach the DB. No-op when `defineContext()` wasn't used or
  for undeclared dimensions. *Design §4/§18.*

- [ ] **Verify against real PgBouncer (transaction pooling).** The PoC proves the
  transaction-local mechanism that *should* work under transaction pooling, but
  never ran against an actual bouncer. Add a docker-compose PgBouncer in
  transaction mode to the test matrix, plus the prepared-statement caveat
  (PgBouncer ≥1.21 or `PDO::ATTR_EMULATE_PREPARES`). *Design §15.*

- [x] **`session` strategy reset on reconnect + Octane flush.**
  `HandlesRlsContext::resetSessionContext()` blanks the persistent session GUCs;
  the provider calls it on each worker boundary (queue `Looping`, Octane
  `RequestReceived`) via `flushSessionContext()` — catching the case the leak
  canary can't (empty scoped stack but live GUC on the pooled connection). An
  overridden `reconnect()` re-establishes context on a fresh backend so it isn't
  silently lost. *Design §16 failure modes.*

- [x] **Loud collision detection for the connection resolver.**
  `RlsServiceProvider::registerConnectionResolver()` throws `ResolverCollision`
  when a foreign pgsql resolver is already registered and `connection_class` is
  still the default (a silent clobber), guiding the user to compose instead. Our
  own resolver is tracked by identity so re-registration isn't a false positive.
  *Design §6.*

- [x] **Multi-connection / read-replica context.** Under the session strategy a
  read/write-split connection's read PDO (the replica, used by plain SELECTs
  outside a transaction) is now given the same GUCs as the write PDO
  (`HandlesRlsContext::setConfig` mirrors to the read PDO when distinct). The
  transaction/wrap strategy already covers any connection via `beginTransaction`
  injection. *Design §18.*
  - *Residual:* a **separate named** replica connection under the session
    strategy isn't synced (the sync callback only touches the default connection,
    and secondary connections resolve lazily). Fine under transaction/wrap.

## P1 — Feature completeness

- [ ] **Publishable app-side `RlsServiceProvider` stub.** The single app-side home
  for `defineContext()` + `resolveContextUsing()` (Fortify/Sanctum pattern).
  Add `rls:install` to publish config + provider + the SQL-functions migration.
  *Design §10.*

- [ ] **`rls:install` / `rls:sync` / `rls:upgrade` commands.** Install SQL helpers
  (migration or `--extension`), regenerate typed helpers from `ContextSchema`,
  and version-migrate `rls.*`. Only `rls:check` and `rls:audit` exist today.
  *Design §8/§12.* Touches: `src/Console`, `RlsFunctions`, `ContextSchema`.

- [ ] **Extension-based install path (`--extension`).** Single-source the SQL and
  emit both the migration and a PGXN extension bundle (`.control` + version
  scripts). For superuser/self-hosted. *Design §8.* Touches: `RlsFunctions`.

- [ ] **`withDefault()` column default.** `scopedBy('tenant_id')->withDefault()`
  → `tenant_id DEFAULT rls.context('tenant_id')::uuid`. Opt-in convenience that,
  with `WITH CHECK`, makes tenant id "impossible to get wrong." *Design §9.*
  Touches: `RlsSchemaMacros`.

- [ ] **`rls.bypass()` semantics per role model, hardened.** Confirm the bypass
  clause is emitted only in `owner` mode and is genuinely inert for the
  restricted role. Add tests that the restricted role cannot self-escape via
  `set_config('app.bypass', ...)`. *Design §5/§7.*

- [ ] **Tenancy-package bridges (stancl / spatie).** Ship a first-class
  `resolveContextUsing(fn () => ['tenant_id' => tenant()?->getKey()])` bridge so
  `laravel-rls` slots in *beneath* existing tenancy packages. *Design §19 — the
  strategic positioning.*

- [ ] **Bypass observability: logging + threshold in `rls:audit`.** `withoutRls()`
  should fire a `RlsBypassed` event and log with the reason; `rls:audit` should
  optionally fail CI over a threshold. Reason string is already required.
  *Design §16.*

- [ ] **Per-table fail-loud granularity for raw SQL.** The guard detects managed
  tables by quoted-name matching in the SQL — fine for the query builder, fuzzy
  for raw SQL. Decide the raw-SQL policy (allowlist? connection-level fallback?).
  *Design §21 open question.* Touches: `HandlesRlsContext::queryTouchesManagedTable`.

---

## P2 — Ergonomics & polish

- [ ] **Earned sugar macros** (`$table->tenantIsolated()`) generated from a
  declared primary scope dimension, rather than only the generic `scopedBy()`.
  *Design §9.*

- [ ] **Richer test assertions** from the design not yet built: `assertVisibleTo`,
  `assertNotVisibleTo`, `assertRlsScoped`, `Rls::explain()` ("why is my result
  empty?" debugger), `dumpRlsPolicies`, `#[RlsContext]` / `#[WithoutRls]`
  attributes, Pest helpers. *Design §13.*

- [ ] **`STABLE` volatility + `PARALLEL SAFE` confirmation.** Helpers are declared
  `STABLE` (index-scan-able). Confirm `PARALLEL SAFE` vs `RESTRICTED` empirically
  on partitioned/parallel scans. *Design §8/§21.*

- [ ] **Nested-transaction tenant-change guard** (`NestedTenantContext` — throw
  when the tenant dimension changes inside an open transaction). *Design §4.*

- [ ] **Migration auto-bypass** (wrap `MigrationsStarted` in `system()`) so data
  backfills under `owner`+FORCE don't silently touch zero rows. *Design §12.*

- [ ] **Package structure**: extract the SQL layer as an extraction-ready module
  (possible future standalone PGXN extension). *Design §3.*

## Open design decisions (need a call before hardening)

1. **`wrap` vs `explicit` as the default boundary.** PoC defaults to `wrap`
   (never accidentally unscoped) but `explicit` is less magical. *Design §21 Q1.*
2. **How self-deprecating the README positioning should be** ("maybe use a global
   scope + PHPStan instead"). Currently honest/blunt.
3. **Whether the tenancy-package bridge is a day-one deliverable** vs docs-only.

---

## Known scope limits (documented, not bugs)

- Statement pooling is unsupported by design.
- `owner` mode does not protect against a compromised credential (owner can drop
  policies) — only `restricted` does.
- RLS protects the Postgres query path only — not Scout/search indexes, Redis
  caches, or BI tools connected directly to the database.
